== Description ==

Close your Shopp store for maintenance, for a season, or for holidays, and redirect Shopp virtual pages to an editable Shopp Closed virtual page, or to an external link of your choice.  While closed, all your Shopp pages are still viewable for logged in Shopp Merchants and Administrators. Includes a dashboard widget so you can see at a glance whether your store is opened or closed, and where there is a button for easy access to the 'Close Shopp' options page.  Requires Shopp e-commerce plugin from shopplugin.net.

== Installation ==

Install from within your WordPress Dashboard under Plugins/Add New.

If you wish to install manually:

1. Upload the `wce-close-shopp-store` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Close Shopp' setting page to close your Shopp and select how visitors will be redirected while your Shopp store is closed.
